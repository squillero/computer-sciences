Let me take you down, because I am going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It is getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It does not matter much to me

Let me take you down, because I am going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you cannot, you know, tune in, but it is all right
That is I think it is not too bad...

Let me take you down, because I am going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

Always, no, sometimes think it is me,
But you know I know when it is a dream
I think a "no", I mean, a "yes", but it is all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Let me take you down, because I am going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
