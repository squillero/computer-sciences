# INFINITE IMPROBABILITY SUPER CALCULATOR -- EVALUATION GRID

## STYLE (3 point)

- Correct use of `if __main__:` and `main()` function: 1 point
- Coherent naming style for variables and functions, ie. all `snake_case` or all `camelCase`: 1 point
- Only local variables, except few used as *constants*, defined in the top of the file, and with names `ALL_CAPITAL`: 1 point

## I/O  (10 point)

- Use of `try/except`: 1 point
- Use of `try/except` around a *small* fragment of code: 1 point
- Correct exception (`OSError`): 1 point
- Correct split of ranges and batches: 2 point
- Minimum number of integer conversion (store ints not strings): 2 point
- Output all the unsafe batches: 1 point
- Output all the unsafe batches without duplicates: 1 point
- Output all the unsafe batches without duplicates in the correct format: 1 point

## ALGORITHM (12 points)

- Reasonable data structure (eg. list of tuples, list of lists): 3 point
- Correct calculation of one unsafe batch: 3 point
- Correct calculation of all unsafe batches: 3 point
- Smart termination of the loop when a batch is identified as unsafe: 3 point
